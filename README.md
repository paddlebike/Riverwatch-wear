Android Wear 2.0 watch for monitoring stream levels

Written in kotlin with complications providing 
 - Gauge Height
 - Gauge Volume
 - Temp (supported on very few gauges)
 
 The current implementation does not support the configuration of the monitored gauge.
 
 Future versions will (hopefully) allow the 
  - Gauge id to be selected
  - Min and Max values for Level and Volume
  - Selection of metric or imperial units
